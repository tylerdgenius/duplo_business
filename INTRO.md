# Duplo Business Service

The aim of this service is to help duplo to manage its business clients interest and automate processes involved in letting business owners create department heads to manage transactions on their behalf.

## Possible actions allowed by service

1. Service allows business owners as well as their chosen department heads to login and register via a registration endpoint
2. Service allows business owners to create department heads if necessary
3. Service allows business to manage the permissions of all their staff
4. Service allows staff to carry out actions in line with their permission scope
5. Service logs each transaction to a provided transaction url

## What was not covered

1. Service spin up using docker to manage instances (Left it out as i was out of time and couldn't test to be sure all would work as expected)
2. Calculation of business score (Was unclear on the criteria for calculating credit score and ran out of time as well)
3. Commit code to provided github repository (There was no provided github repository but I was able to invite the outside collaborators to my public repo for this project)
4. Log transaction details in a mongodb database (It was unclear if you meant to create two different apps to do this or to create two seperate integrations for the database module so I left it until i got better clarity)
